</h1>
<p>This chapter gives you some hints on how to troubleshoot a problem in phpList.&#160;</p>

<h2> Where to go first</h2>
<p>The first place to go for help is <a href="https://phpList.org">phpList.org</a>, especially <a href="https://phpList.org/users">phpList.org/users</a> - this page has the most up-to-date list of support resources and will guide you through the process of getting help step by step.</p>

<h2>Describing your problem</h2>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to problem solving is being able to describe the problem clearly and in enough detail. There is a useful article <a href="http://community.phpList.com/how-to-get-help-on-the-forums/">here</a> to help you with that - it's especially worth a read if you are "not very technical".</p>

<h2>Enable error reporting</h2>

<h3>Verbose phpList logging</h3>

<p>You can tell phpList to log more information about all its behaviour by enabling <a href="https://resources.phplist.com/system/config/verbose">verbose mode</a> in your config.php file:</p>

<blockquote><code>
define('VERBOSE', true);
</code></blockquote>

<p>Then check the following page for logged events, such as generating messages for sending: System -> Log of Events.</p>

<h3>PHP Error reporting</h3>

<p>By default phpList has error reporting disabled. This behaviour will even suppress errors and exceptions from appearing in your web server's logs.</p>

<p>To enable error reporting, change:</p>

<blockquote><code>
error_reporting(0)
</code></blockquote>

<p>to</p>

<blockquote><code>
error_reporting(1)
</code></blockquote>

<p>in the following files:</p>

<ol>
<li>public_html/lists/admin/index.php</li>
<li>public_html/lists/admin/init.php</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you have an error message</h2>
<p>If you have an error message, try pasting it into a search engine. All our forums and documentation are fully indexed by search engines, and your solution is likely to pop up in the results.</p>

<h2>Don't give up!</h2>

<p>If you have a problem that is hard to solve, it could be a "bug." In this case, take a look at the bug reporting process described on the community site - our developer team may be able to fix your problem in the next version.</p>
